# Data Structure and Algorithm Practice

A structured collection of algorithm challenges to prepare for 60-minute technical interviews.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- **Arrays & Strings** - Manipulation, searching, transformations
- **Hash Maps & Sets** - Fast lookups, frequency counting
- **Two Pointers** - Array traversal optimization
- **Sliding Window** - Subarray/substring problems
- **Linked Lists** - Traversal, manipulation, cycle detection
- **Trees & Binary Search Trees** - Traversal, searching, validation
- **Graphs** - BFS, DFS, connectivity
- **Binary Search** - Efficient searching in sorted data
- **Recursion & Backtracking** - Problem decomposition
- **Dynamic Programming** - Optimization problems (medium level)

## 📁 Project Structure

```
interview-prep/
  easy/              # Beginner-friendly challenges
    [challenge-name]/
      problem.md      # Problem description & function skeleton
      solution.js     # Your implementation
      test.js         # Pre-written test cases

  medium/            # Intermediate difficulty challenges
    [challenge-name]/
      problem.md
      solution.js
      test.js
```

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Choose a challenge** from the `easy/` or `medium/` directory
2. **Read the problem** in `problem.md`
3. **Implement your solution** in `solution.js` using the provided skeleton
4. **Run the tests** to validate your solution:
   ```bash
   node [challenge-name]/test.js
   ```

## ✅ Running Tests

Each challenge includes pre-written test cases. Navigate to the challenge directory and run:

```bash
# Example
node easy/two-sum/test.js
```

Tests use Node.js built-in `assert` module - no additional dependencies required.

## 💡 Tips

- Start with **easy** challenges to build confidence
- Time yourself (aim for 15-20 minutes per easy problem, 25-35 for medium)
- Focus on **clarity** and **correctness** first, then optimize
- Practice explaining your approach out loud
- Review multiple solutions after solving
